# Changelog

## v4.0.0 - 08/31/2026

This release refreshes Creator's Toolkit from the interface down, with a cleaner visual system, a more efficient backend, and tighter connections between Lore Codex and RP Archiver.

### What's New

**Lore Codex and RP Archiver Integration**
- Lore Codex storylines can link directly to saved RP Archiver projects
- Updating a linked RP Archiver project can refresh its HTML, CSS, and media inside the relevant Lore Codex projects
- Clearer project-linking controls make connected stories easier to maintain

**Lore Codex GitHub Publishing**
- On Windows, connect a saved Lore Codex project to a local GitHub repository
- Copy new and updated public-site files into the repository without deleting repository-only files
- Public publishing excludes private project data, hidden content, author notes, and linked lorebook source data

**RP Archiver Shared Read-Through**
- Readers can highlight text directly in a generated HTML document to leave comments or suggest corrections
- Comment threads support replies, resolution, and correction status tracking
- Optional deployment files make the shared comment service easier to host with a published project

### What Changed

**Interface**
- Refreshed the UI throughout Creator's Toolkit for a cleaner, more cohesive look
- Improved visual consistency across the main toolkit, Lore Codex, and RP Archiver

**Performance and Reliability**
- Reworked and modularized backend and application code for faster, more efficient operation
- Improved project saving, loading, exporting, and update flows
- Added stronger validation, safer file handling, and more reliable project-data migrations

### What Got Fixed

- Various fixes across the main Creator's Toolkit experience
- Various Lore Codex fixes, including project handling, generated sites, and storyline workflows
- Various RP Archiver fixes, including importing, editing, exporting, and generated read-through pages

### Scope Note

Lorebook Manager and Character Manager were not changed in this release. Updates for both are planned for a future version.

### How to Update

1. **Back up the entire `users/` folder first.** It contains your projects, account data, settings, and encrypted-provider credential key.
2. Run `update.bat` from your current Creator's Toolkit folder, or download v4.0.0 and copy your backed-up `users/` folder into the new installation.
3. Run `server/start-server.bat` or `server/start-server.sh`.

As always, the core toolkit runs locally. Internet access is only needed for setup, updates, and optional online features such as AI providers, GitHub publishing, and hosted shared read-through comments.
