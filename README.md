# Creator's Toolkit v4.0.0

A comprehensive writing suite for writers, roleplayers, and creatives of all types. 

This is a personal project that was created for my own use. It's far from perfect, but I'm always tweaking and improving it! If you have any comments, suggestions, or issues, you can let me know by [e-mailing me](mailto:mokimoko83@gmail.com).

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

> [!WARNING]
> You need Node.js installed on your computer to run Creator's Toolkit.

**Download Node.js:** https://nodejs.org/
- Choose the "LTS" (recommended) version
- Install with default settings
- Restart your computer after installation

### Installation

1. **Download Creator's Toolkit**
   - Extract the `creators-toolkit` folder to wherever you want it (Desktop, Documents, etc.)

2. **First Launch**
   - Navigate to the `creators-toolkit/server/` folder
   - Double-click `start-server.bat` (Windows) or `start-server.sh` (Mac/Linux)
   - Wait for automatic setup (this may take 1-2 minutes the first time)
   - Your browser will automatically open to `http://localhost:9000`

3. **Create Your Account**
   - Click "Register" to create your account
   - This creates your personal user folder and settings
   - OR, alternatively, click "Continue as Guest" to explore as a guest user

4. **Future Launches**
   - Use the `Creator's Toolkit` shortcut created in the main folder
   - Or run `start-server.bat`/`start-server.sh` again

5. **Updating**
   - **VERY IMPORTANT**: Make a COPY of your `users/` folder before updating (all of your user data is in this folder, as long as you have this, your user data cannot be lost)
   - **Updating with update.bat**: Available for v2.1.0 onward. After making a backup copy of your `users/` folder, double-click update.bat in your Creator's Toolkit root directory.
   - **Manual update**: 
      > update.bat for previous versions (v1.0.0, v2.0.0) isn't working, you'll need to manually update!
      1. After making a backup of your `users/` folder, download the latest release and unzip, placing the new `creators-toolkit` folder wherever you'd like on your system
      2. Paste your `users/` folder into the newly extracted Creator's Toolkit folder
      3. Run `start-server.bat` or `start-server.sh` 
      4. All user data and projects will be preserved
      5. If using AI features, remember to enable them in User Settings

## File Organization

After setup, you'll have this structure:

```
creators-toolkit/
├── server/                     # Server files (don't modify)
├── Creator's Toolkit.lnk       # Shortcut to launch
└── users/
    ├── .cowriter-key-store/     # Local master key for encrypted AI provider credentials
    ├── guest/                  # Guest user data 
    ├── userID/                 # Your personal folder
    │   ├── backups/            # File backups
    │   ├── cowriter/           # CoWriter saves/settings     
    │   ├── notebooks/          # Notebook notes/settings
    │   ├── sites/              # Lore Codex projects
    │   ├── roleplays/          # RP Archiver projects
    │   └── settings/           # Your preferences & avatar, Character Manager and Lorebook Manager saves
    └── accounts.json           # User accounts 
```

Keep `.cowriter-key-store/master.key` with the rest of the `users/` folder when backing up or moving an installation. Saved provider credentials cannot be decrypted without it.

## Troubleshooting

### "Site can't be reached" Error in browser
- Node.js isn't installed or not in system PATH
- Download and install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/
- Restart your computer after installation

### "npm is not recognized" Error
- Node.js isn't installed or not in system PATH
- Download and install Node.js from https://nodejs.org/
- Restart your computer after installation

### Server Won't Start
- Make sure you're running from the `server` folder
- Check that port 9000 isn't being used by another program
- Try running as Administrator if on Windows

### Can't Access Projects
- Make sure the server is running (you should see it in your browser at localhost:9000)
- Check that your user folder exists in `users/userID/`
- Try refreshing the browser page

### Lost Data
- Check the `users/userID/` folder for your projects
- Look for `.backup.json` files in your settings folder
- **Always keep a backup of your `users/userID` folder.** This is where all of your project information is located.

### Batch/Shell Script Issues
- If you downloaded from GitHub and get script errors, the line endings may be corrupted
- Delete and recreate the script files with proper line endings
- For Windows: Use CRLF line endings
- For Mac/Linux: Use LF line endings

## Privacy & Security

- Core project data stays on your computer unless you choose to publish a site or use an optional online integration
- No internet is required for the local tools after setup; updates, AI providers, GitHub publishing, and hosted shared comments do require it
- Your projects remain private unless you choose to share them
- User passwords are securely hashed with bcrypt
